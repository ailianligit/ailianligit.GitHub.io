# [Survey] Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning

## 1 Introduction

- An **unbalanced and non-IID** **data partitioning** across **a massive number of unreliable devices with limited communication bandwidth**

- cross-device: mobile and edge device
- cross-silo: involve only a small number of relatively reliable clients
- Federated learning is a machine learning setting where multiple entities (clients) collaborate in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service provider. Each clientâ€™s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead, focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective.



### 1.1 The Cross-Device Federated Learning Setting

- Problem identification - Client instrumentation - Simulation prototyping (optional) - Federated model training - (Federated) model evaluation - Depolyment



#### 1.1.2 A Typical Federated Training Process

- Client selection - Broadcast - Client computation - Aggregation - Model update
- synchronous vs asynchronous



### 1.2 Federated Learning Research

- Precisely describe the details of the particular FL setting of interest
- Explain which aspects of the real-world setting the simulation is designed to capture (and which it is not)
- **Privacy** and **communication efficiency**: **where computation happens** and **what is communicated**
