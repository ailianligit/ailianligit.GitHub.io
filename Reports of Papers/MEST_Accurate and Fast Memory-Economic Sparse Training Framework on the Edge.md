# [MEST@NeurIPS'21] MEST: Accurate and Fast Memory-Economic Sparse Training Framework on the Edge

## Abstract

- Memory-Economic Sparse Training (MEST)
- ensure superior accuracy at high sparsity ratios
  - Elastic Mutation (EM)
  - Soft Memory Bound (&S)
- data efficiency - acceleration of sparse training



## Introduction

- Sparse training
  - the total epoch number is the same as dense training
  - the speed of each training iteration (batch) is significantly improved
- Memory-Economic Sparse Training (MEST): accurate & fast excution
  - Elastic Mutation - explore various sparse topologies
  - soft memory bound - **relaxes on the memory footprint**
