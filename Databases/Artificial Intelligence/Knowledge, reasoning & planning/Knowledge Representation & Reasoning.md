# Knowledge Representation & Reasoning

- KRR: **Symbolic encoding** of propositions believed by some agent and
  their **manipulation** to produce representations of **propositions that**
  **are believed by the agent but not explicitly represented**
- **Knowledge Representation Hypothesis**: any artificial intelligent system is knowledge-based
- **Knowledge Base (KB)**: structures that can be interpreted propositionally and determine the system behavior
- **Knowledge-based system**: system with KB
- Knowledge-based system most suitable for **open-ended** tasks
- Hallmark of knowledge-based system: **cognitive penetrability** (actions depend on beliefs, including implicitly represented beliefs)
